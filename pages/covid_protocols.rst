Current COVID protocols require that facemasks be worn indoors, no matter vaccination status.

In addition, most of the COVID-19 protocols below are based on the logistics of camp and are not activity specific.  Specific plans for each activity at camp will be developed once those activities have been identified.

Outdoors
========

One of the easiest and most attractive methods of minimizing COVID-19 transmission is to be outdoors especially in warm weather, with transmission rates as much as 20x lower when outside.  Camp will occur almost completely outdoors.  There will be activity plans that will utilize the open-air pavilions, but we will minimize our use of lodges and enclosed spaces.  We will also generate secondary activity plans in case of inclement weather that will further utilize and share the open-air, but covered spaces.
