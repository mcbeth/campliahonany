High Adventure (Palmyra and Syracuse Stakes)

Who is invited to attend: Teachers and Priests in the Palmyra and Syracuse Stakes

What will we be doing: TBD

When is High Adventure: 11-13 August 2022

Where: Basecamp will be at BSA Camp Massawepie, however it is likely we will be spending significant time offsite and/or outpost camping  


Campers at the High Adventure portion of camp will be expected to pack all of their gear and supplies including food and water in a backpacking style backpack. Campers should be capable of hiking a few miles in full pack.  


Note that if you do not own gear, there are likely members who are willing to share their gear. If you need help finding gear please contact campliahonapalmyra@gmail.com. Please include which stake you are a member of.

In addition, participants will be required to bring their own backpacking type food and cooking implements (backpacking stove and fuel, utensils etc).
