Campers at the High Adventure portion of camp will be expected to pack all of their gear and supplies including food and water in a backpacking style backpack. Campers should be capable of hiking a few miles in full pack.  

When is High Adventure: 11-13 August 2022

Where: Basecamp will be at BSA Camp Massawepie, however it is likely we will be spending significant time offsite and/or outpost camping  

Food: You will be providing your own meals, and so need food, stove/fuel/ignition, cooking/eating/cleaning supplies, money/packed for the travelling meals.  Do *not* count on using a campfire.  Make sure you know how to clean your gear.  

One site we enjoy for backpacking meal ideas is `Outdoor Eats <https://outdooreats.com/>`_

Equipment:  As desired, pack light enough to walk several miles with all your gear, heavy enough to be comfortable at camp.  Having a day pack to help carry light on Friday (see the 10 essentials) would help)

Many people provide good packing lists.  `REI's is here <https://www.rei.com/dam/backpacking_checklist.pdf>`_

Fundamentally, you need to fill the ten essentials

     1. Navigation (map/compass or GPS, etc)

     2. Headlamp

     3. Sun protection

     4. First aid (including insect repellent)

     5. Knife (for repairs/first aid)

     6. Fire (ignition)

     7. Shelter    

     8. Extra food

     9. Extra water (or purification)

     10. Extra clothes

Note that if you do not own gear, there are likely members who are willing to share their gear. If you need help finding gear please contact campliahonapalmyra@gmail.com. Please include which stake you are a member of.
Generally, the lighter the pack, the better.  But, the lighter the more expensive.  Fundamentally, be careful and intentional about what you pack.

If you can arrange to share gear (shelter, cooking), that is a good way to reduce weight

Shelter:  There are a lot of options from small 1-3 man tents to hammock systems.  Whatever you bring, please make sure you know how to set it up and take it down and pack it back up (even in the rain).

Bears:  If you own a bear cannister, please let us know, include the approximate volume or number of meals that can fit inside.

Resources for Equipment
=======================

Rentals

In my experience, outdoor rental equipment is usually higher-end (warmer, lighter, more comfortable) than the equipment I typically buy.

 - In Syracuse, the Syracuse University Outing Club rents equipment for relatively low prices, but their deposits are pretty expensive.

 - REI will rent all the equipment you could need

 - Likely others, Universities and outdoor groups tend to have lots of resources

Buy Used Gear

If you are starting from scratch, fully equipping a camper can be a large investment.  However, you can often find good deals on used gear.  Some places to look include:

 - Craigslist

 - Facebook Marketplace

 - Garage Sales

 - Old Goat Gear Exchange (Ithaca)

 - `REI <https://www.rei.com/used>`_

 - `North Face <https://www.thenorthfacerenewed.com/>`_

 - `Outdoor Geek <https://www.thenorthfacerenewed.com/>`_

 - `Gear Trade <https://www.thenorthfacerenewed.com/>`_
