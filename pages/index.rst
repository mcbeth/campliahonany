Register for Camp here by June 15th `here <link://slug/registration>`_
######################################################################

Camp Liahona is the summer camp for young men ages 11 to 17 for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in upstate New York. When Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon, he began by using the Urim and Thummim. He graduated to using a seer stone. Using these tools Joseph recorded the prophets Lehi and Nephi exodus from Jerusalem about 600 years B.C. Nephi and Lehi also used a tool, the Liahona, to receive divine revelation. Throughout time God had given men tools to help them receive revelation. It is our hope that Camp Liahona will be a latter-day tool to help Young Men to receive revelation from God.

Objectives
==========

*Strengthen Testimony of Jesus Christ*
  The Liahona was a tool that Lehi used to help him receive revelation. The primary objective of Camp Liahona is to serve as a tool to help young men receive revelation that will strengthen their testimonies of their Savior Jesus Christ.

Secondary Objectives
====================

Unity
  Generate unity and camaraderie in the Aaronic Priesthood across the stakes and region especially for young men in units with few young men.

Fun
  If camp isn’t fun and engaging, we will struggle to get young men there in the first place. Camp Liahona won’t be able to help those who aren’t there.

Challenging
  Often the greatest growth comes through adversity. Camp will provide opportunities for young men to be challenged in safe and encouraging ways.

Tradition
  Why traditions are important? There are a lot of reasons NOT to attend camp, but I can’t help thinking of the council The Good Shepherd gave regarding his sheep. Early in His recorded ministry Christ gives the parable of the Good Shepherd that leaves the ninety and nine to find the lost sheep (`Matt 18:12-14 <https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/18?lang=eng&id=12-14#p12>`_). Then at the end of His ministry, Christ asks Peter, “Lovest thou me?”, Peter answers, “Thou knowest, I love thee”, Christ says, “Feed my lambs [deacons]” this dialog continues 2 more times with Christ admonishing Peter to “Feed my sheep [teachers]” and “Feed my sheep [priests]” (`John 21:15-17 <https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21?lang=eng&id=15-17#p15>`_). Camp Liahona will set the standard upon which future generations of young men make decisions about attending camp. Every year we don’t get ‘the lost sheep’ to camp. it’s harder to get him there the next year. Just like your smallest deacons, little lambs are easy to carry, but they grow into big heavy stubborn teenage sheep that are hard to get close to; they may not recognize the Good Shepherd's voice when he calls (`John 10:3-4 <https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=eng&id=3-4#p3>`_). 
  
Camp Organization
  Coming Soon

Companies, Platoons and Squads
  Whether inherited or adopted, as members of the church we have a pioneer ancestry. Early members of the church traveled across the plains in wagon and handcart companies. Camp Liahona has adopted a similar organization and young men will be divided into companies based on quorum age. The Stake Young Men’s Camp Representatives will serve as Company Captains. Companies will be further divided into platoons and then into Squads. For example, the Deacons Company could theoretically be divided into Platoons of 11-year-old deacons and 12-year-old deacons. Those platoons will be further divided into Squads of approximately 10 YM. Activities will happen at the Squad, Platoon and Company levels.
