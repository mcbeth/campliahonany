Required Forms
==============
There are two sets of forms needing completion.
We are using the BSA medical forms ABC:
`All of A/B/C need to be filled out, C is filled out by your physician <http://www.scouting.org/filestore/HealthSafety/pdf/680-001_ABC.pdf>`_

In addition, in case of emergency, we need to know what over the counter medicines we can use to help the camper
`OTC Permission <https://drive.google.com/file/d/145HkJy8ROKj76vDQcmdPMmjTvokOlXsL/view>`_
