<p>Camp Liahona is the summer camp for young men ages 11 to 17 in the Palmyra Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon, he began by using the Urim and Thummim. He graduated to using a seer stone. Using these tools Joseph recorded the prophets Lehi and Nephi exodus from Jerusalem about 600 years B.C. Nephi and Lehi also used a tool, the Liahona, to receive divine revelation. Throughout time God had given men tools to help them receive revelation. It is our hope that Camp Liahona will be a latter-day tool to help Young Men to receive revelation from God.</p>

<dt><em>Strengthen Testimony of Jesus Christ</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The Liahona was a tool that Lehi used to help him receive revelation. The primary objective of Camp Liahona is to serve as a tool to help young men receive revelation that will strengthen their testimonies of their Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
</dd>
</dl></section><section id="secondary-objectives"><h2>Secondary Objectives</h2>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Unity</dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate unity and camaraderie in the Aaronic Priesthood across the stake especially for young men in units with few young men.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fun</dt>
<dd>
<p>If camp isn’t fun and engaging, we will struggle to get young men there in the first place. Camp Liahona won’t be able to help those who aren’t there.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Challenging</dt>
<dd>
<p>Often the greatest growth comes through adversity. Camp will provide opportunities for young men to be challenged in safe and encouraging ways.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tradition</dt>
<dd>
<p>Why traditions are important? There are a lot of reasons NOT to attend camp especially this year with the additional challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I can’t help thinking of the council The Good Shepherd gave regarding his sheep. Early in His recorded ministry Christ gives the parable of the Good Shepherd that leaves the ninety and nine to find the lost sheep (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/18?lang=eng&amp;id=12-14#p12">Matt 18:12-14</a>). Then at the end of His ministry, Christ asks Peter, “Lovest thou me?”, Peter answers, “Thou knowest, I love thee”, Christ says, “Feed my lambs [deacons]” this dialog continues 2 more times with Christ admonishing Peter to “Feed my sheep [teachers]” and “Feed my sheep [priests]” (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21?lang=eng&amp;id=15-17#p15">John 21:15-17</a>). This is the first ever YM’s camp in our stake. It will set the standard upon which future generations of young men make decisions about attending camp. I’m not worried about the 99, but every year we don’t get ‘the lost sheep’ to camp. it’s harder to get him there the next year. Just like your smallest deacons, little lambs are easy to carry, but they grow into big heavy stubborn teenage sheep that are hard to get close to; they may not recognize the Good Shepherd's voice when he calls (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=eng&amp;id=3-4#p3">John 10:3-4</a>). This year is particularly important to get YM to camp. Our young men have spent a year in isolation, and they are getting comfortable isolating. This is the year to go to extremes rather than take a conservative approach!</p>

<dt>Camp Organization</dt>
<dd>
<p>Coming Soon</p>
</dd>
<dt>Camp Committee</dt>
<dd>
<p>The committee is composed of 1-2 young men from each of the units in the stake. Bishops identified and recommended the young men to participate in the committee. The committee will shape camp and help to create experiences to meet the camp objectives. A few young men from the Camp Committee will receive a calling as a Stake Young Men’s Camp Representatives and will receive additional leadership assignments and responsibilities.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Companies, Platoons and Squads</dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether inherited or adopted, as members of the church we have a pioneer ancestry. Early members of the church traveled across the plains in wagon and handcart companies. Camp Liahona has adopted a similar organization and young men will be divided into companies based on quorum age. The Stake Young Men’s Camp Representatives will serve as Company Captains. In some instances, the company will be further divided into platoons. For example, the Deacons Company can be divided into Platoons and 11-year-old deacons who have never gone to camp will work on basic camp skills while the 12-year-old deacons will work on something else. Platoons can be further divided into smaller squads as necessary.</p>
