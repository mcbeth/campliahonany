<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Do I have to wear a mask at all times in camp?  What if I’ve been vaccinated? What if I’ve got asthma? What if…</dt>
<dd>
<p>A mask must be worn at all times indoors, regardless of vaccination status. Masks are not required at other times in camp.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>I’m an adult coming to camp. Do I need to register?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes, everybody that attends camp even for part of a day will need to register.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Can I bring candy, junkfood, soda, etc.?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes, you may, but you must store food where wildlife cannot get to it. Additionally, if you bring good chocolate and I see it, you might have to share.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>I can’t attend camp in-person. Can I attend virtually?</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is not our intention to run both a virtual and in-person camp. A virtual camp would only be implemented under special circumstances such as quarantine.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>I graduate from high school this year. Can I still come to camp?</dt>
<dd>
<p>You will not be able to attend camp as a Young Man, but there may be opportunities for you to attend camp in another capacity such as cook, lifeguard, skills instructor etc. Please contact us directly to discuss further.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Do I have to give consent to use my son’s picture?</dt>
<dd>
<p>No one will be prohibited from coming to camp, but we would strongly recommend giving consent. If you choose not to give consent it makes it really awkward for your son and everyone else at camp. Campers want to be able to take pictures, but if there is someone whose picture we are not allowed to take then either pictures can’t be taken or your son will be invited to remove himself from the picture. I personally would feel HORRIBLE asking someone not to be in a picture and I imagine that your son would feel just as horrible.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>I have a special diet (food allergies, celiac, vegetarian, etc.). Can you accommodate my special diet?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Please identify that you will require a special diet on your registration form with as many details as possible and we will contact you to discuss options. We will provide you with the camp menu to review to determine which meals could be problematic. After reviewing the camp menu, unfortunately because of the huge diversity of special diets, In most cases, you will be asked to provide your own food for those meals that are problematic.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Do I have to have paper scriptures and/or journal? Can I use electronic scriptures/journal?</dt>
<dd>
<p><a class="reference external" href="../electronics-policy/">See the Electronics Policy</a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Can I use the camera on my phone?</dt>
<dd>
<p>No.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>I thought the Church left the Boy Scouts. Why are we going to a scout camp?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Just to be clear, we are renting the facility and some key staff (waterfront director, shooting range master), but the Palmyra stake will be providing all of the programming and activities. When we were looking for locations to hold Camp Liahona, we contacted approximately 30 camps in upstate NY. Some were already booked the week we are having camp, some were prohibitively expensive, some didn’t have the amenities we wanted (waterfront, shooting sports, etc.). In the end, renting a Boy Scout camp was the best option.</p>

<dt>Can I come to camp with my son?</dt>

<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Is cellular service/wifi available (YM)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>No</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Is Cellular service/ wifi available (adult)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maybe. Adults are also strongly encouraged to refrain from electronics use in camp. If adults need to use electronics a designated remote work space will be provided, and we request that whenever possible, adults utilize that space for electronics use. Depending on camp location there may not be cellular or wifi service available. In addition it is likely that the electronics use area will be in the cafeteria, so there will likely be times when that space is NOT available for electronics use.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Will there be…?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The following is a list of some of the activities at camp.  Swimming, Scripture Study, Camping Skills, Fishing, Firesides, Rifles/Shotgun, Campfires, Knives/Axes, Orienteering, Hiking, Serivce Projects, Canoes/Kayaks, Archery, and others</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Can I bring my own rifle/shotgun/bow for shooting sports?</dt>
<dd>
<p>No. There are materials for shooting sports already at camp.</p>
