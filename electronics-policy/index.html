    <p>Electronics will not be permitted in camp. We want to get away from the world, not bring it to camp with us. There are a lot of potential issues with having electronics in camp including, distraction from activities, damage, the waterfront, theft, inappropriate use in camp. The one extension to this rule is a camera. Campers are encouraged to bring a camera to camp (NOT a cell phone with a camera). At the end of camp we will compile pictures, it will NOT be a requirement, but we would love it if you shared your pictures with us.</p>
<p>Adults are also encouraged to refrain from electronics use in camp. If adults need to use electronics a designated remote work space will be provided, and we request that whenever possible, adults utilize that space for electronics use. The exception is that adults will be permitted to take photographs with their phones. Additionally, adult leaders will occasionally need to communicate with one another during camp.</p>
<section id="consequences"><h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>If adult leaders and/ or Company Captains see electronics in camp they will give a warning. The first warning will come with 2 options.</p>
<p><em>YM can put the electronics away</em></p>
<p><em>YM, can give the electronic device to an adult for safe keeping.</em>
This is not intended as a punishment, but rather an option to remove the temptation. The device will be stored somewhere locked, and out of the elements. The device can be returned at any time. (Leaders will not necessarily drop what they are doing to return devices, but they will attempt to make a reasonable accommodation.)</p>
<p>A second warning will result in confiscation of the electronic device which will then be returned at the end of camp. In extreme cases confiscated devices will be returned to a parent.</p>
<p>Note that any camper who uses electronics to bully other campers or take inappropriate pictures will have the electronic devices confiscated immediately! They will not be returned until after discussing with appropriate priesthood and/or legal authorities. Any electronics confiscated for inappropriate use will only be returned to a parent or guardian.</p>
</section><section id="do-i-have-to-have-paper-scriptures-and-or-journal-can-i-use-electronic-scriptures-journal"><h2>Do I have to have paper scriptures and/or journal?  Can I use electronic scriptures/journal?</h2>
<p>I would very strongly recommend paper scriptures and journals. However, I taught seminary for a few years and many of my students only used electronic scriptures and I know many YM prefer electronic versions. Electronic scriptures have many advantages including being able to carry a wide range of additional study materials. However, one of the problems with electronic scriptures is that it’s very easy to get distracted. Electronic scriptures and journals will hesitantly be permitted exclusively for scripture study and journaling, but only public spaces where someone could come up behind you and see that you are reading scriptures.</p>
